### Installation

The easiest way to install `RAnEnExtra` is to use the `devtools` package. If you do not have this package installed already, please install the package by running:

```
install.packages('devtools')
```

`devtools` provides a nice function to directly install packages from GitHub. To install `RAnEnExtra`, use the following line:

```
devtools::install_github("Weiming-Hu/RAnEnExtra")
```

If you check the [Suggests](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/RAnEnExtra/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L20) field of in the [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/RAnEnExtra/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file, there are a couple of optional libraries suggested by `RAnEnExtra`. **You don't have to install them right away**. When you are using a particular function that requires any of the packages, you can decide to install them if you are receiving errors about missing packages.
